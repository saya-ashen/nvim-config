# Enhanced nvim-config - LazyVim-style improvements

This document summarizes the improvements made to make your nvim-config more like LazyVim while fixing the folding issues.

- **Solution**: 
  - Enhanced UFO configuration with LSP provider support
  - Added proper fold settings (`foldmethod = "manual"`, excluded folds from session)
